Task - Design a circuit that can indicate the direction of the wind using LEDs. The LEDs will move
       in sequence in the direction of the wind thus creating a hazard light system. The LED patterns
       are as follows:
       
       1. Right to Left: 001 --> 010 --> 100
       2. Calm: 101 --> 010
       3. Left to Right: 100 --> 010 --> 001
